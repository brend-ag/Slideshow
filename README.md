# Slideshow
A local full-stack application that dynamically generates a slideshow with captions by parsing through a folder of images on the server side. It was developed with HTML, JS, CS, and PHP on a Windows 10 machine using Google Chrome as the web browser. The slideshow was part of the coursework for CSC 220: Advanced Programming Techniques at Smith College. The application was hosted on a Smith College server with the help of [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).

![A screenshot of the first slide in the dynamically generated slideshow. It shows a picture above the clouds with a gradient in the sky indicating a far off sunset. The slide is labeled "a view of beautiful fluffy clouds." There are left and right arrows on the slide, indicating to move on to another slide. Below the slide are interactive gray dots that can also be used to navigate through the slideshow.](slideshowApp.jpg)
